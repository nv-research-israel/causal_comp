## AO-CLEVr Dataset

AO-CLEVr is a new synthetic-images dataset containing images of "easy" Attribute-Object categories, based on the CLEVr framework (Johnson et al. CVPR 2017). AO-CLEVr has attribute-object pairs created from 8 attributes: \{ red, purple, yellow, blue, green, cyan, gray, brown \} and 3 object shapes \{sphere, cube, cylinder\}, yielding 24 attribute-object pairs. Each pair consists of 7500 images. Each image has a single object that consists of the attribute-object pair. The object is randomly assigned one of two sizes (small/large), one of two materials (rubber/metallic), a random position, and random lightning according to CLEVr defaults.
